title={Effects of Two Linguistically Proximal Varieties on the Spectral and Coarticulatory Properties of Fricatives: Evidence from Athenian Greek and Cypriot Greek},      
journal={Frontiers in Psychology},
volume={8},
pages={1945},

abstract={Several studies have explored the acoustic structure of fricatives,
                  yet there has been very little acoustic research on the
                  effects of dialects on the production of fricatives.  This
                  article investigates the effects of two linguistically
                  proximal Modern Greek dialects, Athenian Greek and Cypriot
                  Greek on the temporal, spectral, and coarticulatory properties
                  of fricatives and aims to determine the acoustic properties
                  that convey information about these two dialects.  Productions
                  of voiced and voiceless labiodental, dental, alveolar,
                  palatal, and velar fricatives were extracted from a speaking
                  task from typically speaking female adult speakers (25 Cypriot
                  Greek and 20 Athenian Greek speakers).  Measures were made of
                  spectral properties, using a spectral moments analysis.  The
                  formants of the following vowel were measured and second
                  degree polynomials of the formant contours were calculated.
                  The findings showed that Athenian Greek and Cypriot Greek
                  fricatives differ in all spectral properties across all places
                  of articulation.  Also, the co-articulatory effects of
                  fricatives on following vowel were different depending on the
                  dialect.  Duration, spectral moments, and the starting
                  frequencies of $F1$, $F2$, $F3$, and $F4$ contributed the most
                  to the classification of dialect.  These findings provide a
                  solid evidence base for the manifestation of dialectal
                  information in the acoustic structure of fricatives.}
