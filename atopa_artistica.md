description: "Place is not always relevant. We view the thing for what it is, and the thing becomes a category of itself, a name. Put it in a story, and you have created a novelty with its own reference. To quote Michael Foucault --the thing we apprehend in one great leap, the thing that, by means of the fable, is demonstrated as the exotic charm of another system of thought, is the limitation of our own, the stark impossibility of thinking **that**--. Thus, the things' onsets cannot be anything but objects beyond place, having an inherent potentiality to create art, they --Atopa Artistica--!"
