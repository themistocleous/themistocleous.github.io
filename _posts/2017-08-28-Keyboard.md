# Keyboard Layouts for Windows and MACOS
I am very pleased to announce the release of four keyboard layouts. The keyboard layouts can be useful to those working on phonetics, phonology, sociophonetics, etc. These keyboard layouts aim to facilitate the easy access to symbols that do not exist in the standard keyboard layouts. One way to access special symbols is to assign specific symbols in some applications, such as Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer, but with most applications this is not even an option. The best way to address this issue across the system is by installing a specified keyboard layout. There are four keyboard layouts available for free: two for writing Cypriot Greek (one for Windows and one from MACOS), a layout for accessing IPA symbols, and a layout for adding symbols when working with historical manuscripts (paleography). .
