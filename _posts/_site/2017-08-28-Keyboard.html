<p>Often we need to type symbols that do not exist in the standard keyboard layouts. One way to solve this issue is to assign specific symbols in several applications, such as Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer but with most applications this is not even an option. The best way to address this issue is by installing a specified keyboard layout. I created three keyboard layouts: one for writing Cypriot Greek and includes the characters that are needed to produce the post-alveolars,  a layout for accessing IPA symbols, and a layout for adding symbols when working with historical manuscripts (paleography).</p>
