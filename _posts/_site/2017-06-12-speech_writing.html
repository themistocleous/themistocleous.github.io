<p>Cypriot Greek is a language variety that has no official writing
 system. To address this issue, we provided a linguistically informed proposal
 for the codification of Cypriot Greek (graphemes and writing rules), which was
 incorporated for the first time in a dictionary of Cypriot Greek (see for more
 information Themistocleous, Katsoyannou, Armosti, \&amp; Christodoulou, 2012a,
 2012b, Armosti, Christodoulou, Katsoyannou, \&amp; Themistocleous, 2014). The
 International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is a system for representing the sounds
 of world languages produced by typical and atypical speakers. In Themistocleous
 (2011), I provide a computational phonological grammar and computer application
 that allows the conversion of a text written in Standard Modern Greek and
 Cypriot Greek into IPA. The software application is titled IPAGreek and
 contains both the lexical and postlexical phonological rules of Greek. The
 phonological grammar includes both lexical and postlexical rules (e.g.,
 assimilation, dissimilation, palatalization). The application has been employed
 for the transcription of the pronunciation in the Cypriot Greek dictionary
 mentioned above. I indent to open source this application and make it available
 in my GitHub repository.</p>
