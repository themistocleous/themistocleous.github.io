<p style="text-align:justify;">Deep Neural Networks, SVMs, HMMs  constitute the powerhouse of most applications
in  text-to-speech, speech  perception, machine  translation, image  description
generation, and  semantic interpretation. They  also offer insights  about human
perception and cognition, namely how humans process, store, retrieve information
from  speech signals,  texts, vision,  etc.   I explore  these architectures  to
understand how humans map speech into abstract linguistic categories.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Specifically, in Themistocleous (2017), I  provide a classification model of two
Modern  Greek  dialects,   namely  Athenian  Greek  and   Cypriot  Greek,  using
information from  formant dynamics  of F1,  F2, F3, F4  and vowel  duration. The
measurements   were  employed   in  classification   experiments,  using   three
classifiers: Linear  Discriminant Analysis, Flexible Discriminant  Analysis, and
C5.0. The  latter outperformed the  other classification models, resulting  in a
higher classification  accuracy of the  dialect. C5.0 classification  shows that
duration and  the zeroth  coefficient of F2,  F3 and F4  contribute more  to the
classification of  the dialect than the  other measurements; it also  shows that
formant dynamics are important for the classification of dialect.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The ability to accurately perceive whether a  speaker is asking a question or is
making a statement is crucial  for any successful interaction. However, learning
and classifying tonal patterns has been  a challenging task for automatic speech
recognition  and for  models  of  tonal representation,  as  tonal contours  are
characterized by significant variation. In Bernardi and Themistocleous (2017) we
provide a  classification model of  Cypriot Greek questions and  statements.  We
evaluate two  state-of-the-art network  architectures: a Long  Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) network  and a convolutional  network (ConvNet). The  ConvNet outperforms
the LSTM in the classification task  and exhibited an excellent performance with
95% classification accuracy.</p>
