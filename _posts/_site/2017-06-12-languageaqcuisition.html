<p>In a current article
published this year in Frontiers in Communication, (Grohmann, Papadopoulou, and
Themistocleous 2017), we investigated the development of object clitic
placement by children acquiring Cypriot Greek. Greek-speaking Cyprus is
sociolinguistically characterized by diglossia between two varieties of Greek,
the local Cypriot Greek and the official Standard Modern Greek. Because of the
effects of these two varieties, clitics may be placed postverbally (enclisis)
or preverbally (proclisis) in the same syntactic environment: the former is a
property of Cypriot Greek and the latter is typically considered an effect of
Standard Modern Greek. In the study, we investigated (a) how such bilectal
speakers distinguish between the two Greek varieties with respect to clitic
placement; (b) how the acquisition of clitics develops over time; (c) how, and
which, sociolinguistic factors determine clitic placement; and (d) how
schooling may affect clitic placement. To this purpose, a sentence completion
task was used to elicit clitic productions, administered to 431 children around
Cyprus ranging from 2 years 8 months to 8 years 11 months. The data were
analyzed using the C5.0 machine-learning algorithm. The study provides a
computational model of the interaction of (socio-)linguistic factors on the
development of clitic placement, which shows that speakers acquire the relevant
features very early, yet compartmentalization of form and function according to
style emerges only as they engage in the larger speech community. In addition,
the effects of sociolinguistic factors on clitic placement appear gradually.</p>
