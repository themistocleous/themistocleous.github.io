<p>I have created a new GitHub repository where you may find some Praat scripts from my own collection. I will be updating this repository as soon as I have something new to add.</p>

<h2 id="opening-and-saving-files">Opening and Saving Files</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/themistocleous/praat_scripts/raw/master/open_all.praat">open_all:</a> its main purpose is to open all objects in Objects’ window.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/themistocleous/praat_scripts/raw/master/save_raw.praat">save_raw:</a> saves all sound files in object’s window as raw 16-bit little-endian files.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/themistocleous/praat_scripts/raw/master/saveall.praat">save_all:</a> saves all objects in the object window.</p>

<h2 id="view-and-edit-files">View and Edit Files</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/themistocleous/praat_scripts/raw/master/view_edit_all.praat">view_edit_all:</a> This script opens all wav files in the Praat Objects’ window. If you want to open the files with their associated TextGrid, I have found <a href="https://github.com/themistocleous/praat_scripts/raw/master/check2.praat">this script</a> created by Pauline Welby extremely useful.</p>
