## Writing and speech

Cypriot Greek is a language variety that has no official writing
 system. To address this issue, we provided a linguistically informed proposal
 for the codification of Cypriot Greek (graphemes and writing rules), which was
 incorporated for the first time in a dictionary of Cypriot Greek (see for more
 information Themistocleous, Katsoyannou, Armosti, \& Christodoulou, 2012a,
 2012b, Armosti, Christodoulou, Katsoyannou, \& Themistocleous, 2014). The
 International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is a system for representing the sounds
 of world languages produced by typical and atypical speakers. In Themistocleous
 (2011), I provide a computational phonological grammar and computer application
 that allows the conversion of a text written in Standard Modern Greek and
 Cypriot Greek into IPA. The software application is titled IPAGreek and
 contains both the lexical and postlexical phonological rules of Greek. The
 phonological grammar includes both lexical and postlexical rules (e.g.,
 assimilation, dissimilation, palatalization). The application has been employed
 for the transcription of the pronunciation in the Cypriot Greek dictionary
 mentioned above. I indent to open source this application and make it available
 in my GitHub repository.

 \subsection{Future Research}  My aim is to contact frontier research on speech
 communication, which will improve the well-being of both typical and atypical
 populations. During recent decades, the proportion of the population aged over
 60 has increased throughout the world. According to the United Nations, this
 proportion has risen from 8\% in 1950 to 12\% in 2013, while it is expected to
 reach 21\% in the next forty years (D.o.E.S.A., 2013). This increase imposes
 great challenges in terms of how we can improve the quality of life for elderly
 people and the quality of life for people with MCI and Alzheimer's Disease \&
 Dementia. Therefore, it is important to understand how speech communication
 skills differ in both typically and atypically aging population in interaction
 (including using speech and prosody in conversations, e.g., for turn
 allocation) by controlling for the effects of cognitive decline on Working
 Memory, Speed of Processing, and Inhibition. To this purpose, I want to employ
 acoustic analysis of typical and atypical productions in interactions and
 state-of-the art machine learning methods, such as deep neural network
 architectures, to develop a model of their acoustic productions. The model will
 enable a better understanding of language pathology and the development of
 diagnostic tools  that can be accessible to the whole population using smart
 technologies and assist treatment in daily environments, e.g., homes, cars,
 hospitals, and rehabilitation centres, through internet of things and connected
 devices with speech.
