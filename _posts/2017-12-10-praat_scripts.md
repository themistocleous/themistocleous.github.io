I have created a new GitHub repository where you may find some Praat scripts from my own collection. I will be updating this repository as soon as I have something new to add.

## Opening and Saving Files
[open_all:](https://github.com/themistocleous/praat_scripts/raw/master/open_all.praat) its main purpose is to open all objects in Objects' window.

[save_raw:](https://github.com/themistocleous/praat_scripts/raw/master/save_raw.praat) saves all sound files in object's window as raw 16-bit little-endian files.

[save_all:](https://github.com/themistocleous/praat_scripts/raw/master/saveall.praat) saves all objects in the object window.

## View and Edit Files
[view_edit_all:](https://github.com/themistocleous/praat_scripts/raw/master/view_edit_all.praat) This script opens all wav files in the Praat Objects' window. If you want to open the files with their associated TextGrid, I have found [this script](https://github.com/themistocleous/praat_scripts/raw/master/check2.praat) created by Pauline Welby extremely useful.
