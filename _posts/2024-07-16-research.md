Here's a selection of Python packages and utility software I've found valuable. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but I hope you discover something useful. Let me know if you'd like me to add any specific tools. The selection is updated regularly.

# Language Analysis
## Open Brain AI
Open Brain AI (OBAI) is a computational platform. First, it aims to provide advanced AI tools to facilitate spoken and written language analysis, automate the analysis process, and reduce the workload associated with time-consuming tasks. 

The platform currently incorporates multilingual tools for English, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish. 

The tools involve models for 

- i. audio transcription, 
- ii. automatic translation, 
- iii. grammar error correction, 
- iv. transcription to the International Phonetic Alphabet, 
- v. readability scoring, 
- vi phonology, morphology, syntax, semantic measures (e.g., counts and proportions), and lexical measures. 

Second, it aims to support clinicians in conducting their research and automating everyday tasks with “OBAI Companion,” an AI language assistant that facilitates language processing, such as structuring, summarizing, and editing texts. OBAI also provides tools for automating spelling and phonology scoring.
