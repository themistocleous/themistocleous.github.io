<h2>Short Bio</h2>
<p>I am a computational neurolinguist who investigates how speech, language, and communication patterns can be leveraged to understand, monitor, and support individuals with neurodegenerative conditions. My research focuses on developing machine learning models for the automatic detection, differential diagnosis, and longitudinal tracking of Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA), Alzheimer’s disease, and Mild Cognitive Impairment using multimodal data—including spoken language, structural and functional MRI, and neurophysiological assessments. I have developed <em>Open Brain AI</em> (https://openbrainai.com/), a computational platform to automate speech and language analysis for clinical and educational research.</p>

<p>My work spans three interconnected areas: (1) computational modeling of language and speech biomarkers in neurodegeneration, (2) the interface between linguistic structure (particularly information structure and prosody) and cognitive decline, and (3) sociolinguistic and individual variability in speech as indicators of neurological health. I am also interested in transdiagnostic approaches to early detection and digital phenotyping of cognitive and communicative disorders. My research integrates methods from computational linguistics, cognitive neuroscience, and clinical neurology, with a strong emphasis on real-world applicability and ethical AI. I collaborate internationally with research centers in the USA, Sweden, Greece, and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Having benefited from supportive academic mentorship, I am committed to fostering inclusive research environments and actively support early-career researchers—particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds—in computational and clinical neuroscience. I welcome opportunities for collaboration, dialogue, and engagement with clinicians, technologists, and policymakers working at the intersection of language, cognition, and brain health. Please feel free to get in touch.</p>
