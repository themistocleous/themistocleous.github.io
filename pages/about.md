<p style="text-align:justify">Charalambos (Haris) K. Themistocleous is a Professor of Speech, Language, and Communication at the <a href="https://www.uv.uio.no/isp/">Department of Special Needs Education</a> at the <a href="http://uio.no">University of Oslo</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">His research focuses on quantifying the impact of brain damage on speech, language, and communication, by developing automatic speech and language measures. A primary goal of his work is to create early diagnostic and prognostic models for these conditions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Dr. Themistocleous is developing AI tools for the automatic analysis of speech and language and leads the development of <a href="http://openbrainai.com">Open Brain AI</a>, a computational platform that supports clinicians in studying language impairments in patients.</p>
