<p style="text-align:justify">Charalambos (Haris) K. Themistocleous is a Professor of Speech, Language, and Communication at the <a href="https://www.uv.uio.no/isp/">Department of Special Needs Education</a> at the <a href="http://uio.no">University of Oslo</a>.  His academic journey includes a Ph.D. in Linguistics from the University of Athens, where he graduated summa cum laude, and extensive postdoctoral research in computational neurolinguistics at Johns Hopkins University and computational linguistics at the University of Gothenburg.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">His research aims at quantifying the effects of brain damage on speech, language, and communication. He utilizes AI methods, including machine learning, natural language processing, and acoustic phonetics, to develop models for the early diagnosis and prognosis of conditions such as aphasia, dementia, and mild cognitive impairment. His innovative work integrates linguistic analysis with multimodal data analysis to deepen our understanding of these neurological disorders. Dr. Themistocleous has been instrumental in securing significant research funding and has participated in numerous high-impact projects at the University of Oslo, Johns Hopkins University, and the University of Gothenburg.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">A key initiative led by Dr. Themistocleous is <a href="http://openbrainai.com">Open Brain AI</a>, a state-of-the-art computational platform that automates the analysis of speech and language. This powerful tool provides clinicians, researchers, and educators with real-time transcription, segmentation, and linguistic analysis of speech. He has also developed a suite of digital tools for assessing spelling, phonology, and semantics, which have been widely adopted in both clinical and research environments.</p>
