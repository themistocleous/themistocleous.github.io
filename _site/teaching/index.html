<span style="color:#000000;">This course investigates the speech sounds of human languages from an articulatory and an acoustic point of view as well as the basic notions behind the way in which speech sounds are organized into sound systems of different human languages. At a supra-segmental level, it investigates prosodic systems (syllable structure and stress) of human languages. Whilst it starts off with the fundamental concepts of phonetics and phonology, at the same time, it provides the foundation for more advanced treatments of the above topics through different theoretical frameworks within contemporary phonology.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">The course is arranged thematically: each week, we will examine a major topic of phonetic and/or phonological concern, providing theoretical, methodological and empirical work (observation and or instrumental). Students are responsible for writing a short, weekly assignment paper or small projects, to be handed in before each week’s final class. Students should, at a minimum, be prepared to discuss <em>each</em>of that class period’s focus questions in conference.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">Assignments must be turned in on time to receive full credit and comments. Extensions will be granted only in cases of illness, family emergency, etc. Late assignments will not be accepted for credit if turned in after the problem set has been returned to students, or discussed in class, whichever comes first. You are encouraged to work on problem sets together, but your answers must be written up separately and in your own words.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">Assuming no prior knowledge of Phonetics and Phonology, the course introduces students to the basic notions of these fields. The first part of this course explores the production, perception, and acoustics of speech sounds. More specifically, the course introduces the basic notions of sound structure, demonstrates how sounds are transcribed using the International Phonetic Alphabet, and explores the distinctive features of sounds. The second part provides an introduction to suprasegmental structure. The course is arranged thematically: each week, we will examine a major topic providing theoretical, methodological and empirical work.</span>

More specifically, the course has the following goals:</span>
<ol>
	<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">to introduce students to the most influential areas of phonological theory,</span></li>
	<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">to discuss and compare answers and solutions phonological theories provide to major phonological questions,</span></li>
	<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">to enable students to read the current scholarly literature with critical understanding and perspective,</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;">to show how phonology interacts with other linguistic domains such as phonetics, morphology, syntax, and language acquisition.</span></li>

<div class="column">
<div class="page" title="Page 1">

This course provides an introduction to research methodology, experimental design and statistics for linguists. By the end of the course, students will be able to
<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#333333;">define a research hypothesis and articulate a research question,</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#333333;">plan a research project and design an experiment,</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#333333;">define response variables,</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#333333;">define explanatory variables,</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#333333;">perform the right statistics test,</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#333333;">execute the test on the R statistics package,</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#333333;">learn to create graphs and present their findings.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color:#333333;">The course covers these topics through the discussion of key research methods and resources and through the analysis of real-life datasets, by using R code.  It will therefore be of major interest to everyone interested in designing experiments and performing statistical analyses, but it is also of utmost importance for everyone interested in reading and understanding research articles.</span>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">‘Information Structure and Prosody’ is indented to provide students with a sound coverage of the topics related to the melodic patterns of Speech Prosody and their interactions with ‘Information Structure’ and ‘Discourse’. The course presents the state of the art in the field; it demonstrates current research trends and uncovers potential directions for future research. It is therefore of major interest to everyone studying phonology and semantics and their interaction. The course is arranged thematically: each week, we examine a major topic, providing theoretical, methodological and empirical work (base on observation &amp; experimentation).</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Why do we speak differently from our grandparents? Why speakers from some areas sound strange? What do we mean when we say this woman/man sounds like a doctor? Why languages change and how do we study language change? How do linguists study language variation? This class provides an introduction to Sociophonetics, the multifaceted subfield of linguistics in which phonetics, phonology and sociolinguistics interact. We will cover the following topics:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">(a) sociophonetics: approaches, methodologies, and ethics.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">(b) field studies and data collection.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">(c) phonetic/phonological variation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">(d) language change.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">This class is essentially a trip into language and society. We will meet the main practitioners of the field. We will try to uncover the philosophies that underlie their thought and the ideas that formed their approaches. We will explore thoroughly the phonemic systems of languages and try to uncover the reasons of change. </span></p>

University of Cyprus. </strong><span style="color:#000000;">The ‘English Phonetics and Phonology: Advanced Level’ is an integrated and structured course of key topics representing the state of the art in the field of phonetics and phonology. Focusing on linguistic, interactional, social, cultural and ideological issues, the course is organized to provide a graded introduction to Phonetics and Phonological theory which is essential for sociolinguistic research. The course includes:</span>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
	<li><span style="color:#000000;">the study of fundamental concepts in phonetics and phonology,</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;">the study of the sociolinguistic aspects of speech and</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;">the study of interactional phonetics and phonology.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color:#000000;">It covers all these topics through the discussion of key research methods and resources, reading classic texts written by leading theorists, highlighting key concepts in different traditions of phonetics and phonology and finally by studying important papers by contemporary specialists showing what phonetics and phonology is able to achieve if applied to different social issues and social settings. It will therefore be  of major interest to everyone interested in phonetics, phonology, conversation analysis, discourse analysis and sociolinguistics.</span>
