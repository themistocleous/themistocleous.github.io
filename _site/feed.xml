<p>Every year more than ten million individuals develop dementia, with almost fifty-five million worldwide now living with dementia.
Dementia is the progressive deterioration of cognitive, linguistic, and social functioning that affects the quality of life, including the physical, social, and economic conditions of individuals, their families, and society.
There are types of dementia depending on the symptoms, underlying pathology.</p>

<ul>
  <li>ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE</li>
  <li>VASCULAR DEMENTIA</li>
  <li>PARKINSON’S DISEASE</li>
  <li>FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA</li>
  <li>MIXED DEMENTIA</li>
  <li>LANGUAGE SYMPTOMS</li>
</ul>

<p>Language symptoms depend on the type of dementia.</p>

<p>Individuals with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) constitute the larger group of individuals with dementia. They are characterized by a progressive deterioration of memory, language, conversation, and ability to perform everyday activities.</p>

<p>Individuals with Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA), a progressive neurological condition, are impaired in speech and language.</p>

<p>Individuals with PPA are grouped into three variants based on their distinct underlying neuropathology and area of brain damage.</p>

<p>According to current classification criteria, their characteristic neuropathology and damage patterns give rise to different discourse deficits across three variants, namely in</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>INDIVIDUALS WITH THE NON-FLUENT PPA VARIANT (NFVPPA)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>INDIVIDUALS WITH THE SEMANTIC PPA VARIANT (SVPPA), AND</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>INDIVIDUALS WITH THE LOGOPENIC PPA VARIANT (LVPPA)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Individuals with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) are characterized by a progressive deterioration of movement functioning, which impairs balance, speaking, language, chewing, and swallowing.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It impairs speech, language, and communication:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Language comprehension</li>
  <li>Language production of spoken and written language</li>
  <li>Using language effectively for communication.</li>
  <li>It involves deficits in one or more language modalities, including phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.</li>
  <li>It can also impair aspects of functional communication, e.g.,</li>
  <li>Emotions self-monitoring</li>
  <li>Theory of Mind</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="dementia-diagnosis">DEMENTIA DIAGNOSIS</h1>
<p>The neurocognitive assessment aims to evaluate individuals’ condition and provide early diagnosis, prognosis, and quantify intervention efficacy.
Computational Language Assessment (CLA) informs the clinician and the patient by quantifying the symptoms of dementia on language and enabling monitoring of disease progression over time.
CLA provides tools that can screen individuals for dementia and provide a recommendation on whether to visit a clinician.
Although there is no treatment for dementia, pharmaceutical solutions that can potentially that slow down the progression of the disease show positive results and are getting approved.
Therefore, early-stage identification, and assessment of individuals with dementia are of utmost importance to enable interventions that can delay the progression of dementia and support family planning.</p>

While technically considered a symptom rather than a disease, the term “stuttering” is often used to denote both the symptom and the disorder.</p>

<p>Stuttering typically manifests during childhood, often between the ages of two and five. Many children go through a phase of “developmental stuttering” which is a normal part of language development and usually resolves on its own. However, for some children, stuttering persists and can become a chronic issue.</p>

<p>These disruptions are not easily controlled and can be both audible and silent. Stuttering often comes with additional physical movements and negative emotional responses such as fear, embarrassment, or irritation. Specifically, children who stutter may experience long- and short-term consequences:</p>

<p><strong>Communication Difficulties:</strong>  The primary consequence of stuttering is difficulty in fluent communication. This can impact a child’s ability to express their thoughts, needs, and feelings clearly.</p>

<p><strong>Emotional and Psychological Impact:</strong>  Children who stutter may become frustrated or embarrassed about their speech. This can lead to  anxiety or decreased self-esteem, especially in social or academic situations. They may also become more reserved, choosing to refrain from speaking in certain situations to avoid stuttering.</p>

<p><strong>Social Challenges:</strong>  Stuttering can affect a child’s social interactions. They may be misunderstood, teased, or bullied, resulting in social isolation.</p>

<p><strong>Educational Impact:</strong>  Stuttering can influence academic performance. Children may avoid participating in classroom discussions, reading aloud, or giving presentations, which could affect their learning and grades.</p>

<p><strong>Impact on Future Life:</strong> If left unmanaged, stuttering can persist into adulthood, affecting academic, personal, and professional life. The earlier the intervention, the better the outcomes are likely to be.&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Research" /><category term="Project" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stuttering is a speech disorder characterized by interruptions or disfluencies in verbal expression, where individuals that stutter involuntarily repeat or prolong sounds, syllables, or words.

<p>Speech, language, and communication deficits are a common symptom in several neurodegenerative conditions. These deficits are often among the first symptoms to emerge, which makes them particularly important for early detection, diagnosis, and treatment planning. Traditional neurological assessments routinely include an evaluation of these functions as they provide critical insights into the progression of neurocognitive diseases. However, traditional speech and language evaluations pose significant challenges for clinicians as they are time-consuming and require substantial resources. In this context, we argue that the use of machine learning methodologies, natural language processing (NLP), and modern artificial intelligence (AI) for Language Assessment represents a significant improvement over conventional manual assessment methods. Open Brain AI aims to help clinicians and researchers employ CLA in their everyday practices.</p>

<p>Computational Language Assessment (CLA) leverages these advanced technologies to accomplish three primary goals. First, it enables a comprehensive neuro-cognitive evaluation of speech, language, and communication in elderly and high-risk individuals for dementia. This is crucial as early detection of dementia and other neurocognitive diseases is essential for timely intervention and better patient outcomes. Second, CLA facilitates the diagnosis, prognosis, and assessment of therapy efficacy in at-risk and language-impaired populations. This helps in personalizing treatment plans and monitoring progress over time. Third, it allows easier extensibility to assess patients from a wide range of languages. This is particularly important in a globalized world where patients may speak a variety of languages that are not always comprehensively covered by traditional assessment tools.</p>

<p>By employing advanced AI models, CLA can also provide valuable insights into the neurocognitive theory on the relationship between language symptoms and their neural bases. This can help in understanding the underlying mechanisms of language and communication deficits in neurodegenerative diseases and inform the development of more effective interventions.</p>

<p>Finally, CLA significantly advances our ability to optimize the prevention and treatment of elderly individuals with communication disorders. This is of utmost importance as communication is a key aspect of social engagement, which in turn is associated with better cognitive and emotional well-being. By improving the assessment and management of communication disorders, CLA can help elderly individuals maintain better social engagement, thereby contributing to healthier aging.</p>

<p>Aphasia is a language disorder affecting a person’s ability to communicate. It is caused by damage to the brain’s language centers, typically resulting from a stroke, brain injury, or neurodegenerative conditions.</p>

<p>ASHA defines aphasia as an acquired neurogenic communication disorder that impairs the comprehension and production of spoken and written language and the ability to use language effectively for communication. It involves deficits in one or more language modalities, including phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.</p>

<p>Aphasia can manifest in several ways depending on the specific areas of the brain affected and the severity of the impairment. It can impact both expressive language skills (such as speaking and writing) and receptive language skills (such as understanding spoken and written language). The specific symptoms and severity of aphasia can vary widely among individuals.</p>

<p>Treatment for aphasia typically involves a comprehensive approach that includes language therapy, communication strategies, and augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) techniques. The goal is to improve communication abilities, enhance quality of life, and help individuals with aphasia participate more fully in social, academic, and vocational activities.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Research" /><category term="Project" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sickness is an impediment that affects the body not what you choose to do (…) choose to follow this for all the things that happen to you: because you will realize that it impedes something else and not yourself.
