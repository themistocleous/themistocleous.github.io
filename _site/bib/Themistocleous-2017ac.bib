ABSTRACT={Several  studies  have  explored  the  acoustic  structure  of
fricatives,  yet there  has been very little  acoustic research  on  the effects  of
dialects on the production of fricatives.  This article investigates the effects
of two linguistically proximal Modern Greek dialects, Athenian Greek and Cypriot
Greek on the temporal, spectral, and coarticulatory properties of fricatives and
aims to  determine the acoustic  properties that convey information  about these
two  dialects.   Productions  of   voiced  and  voiceless  labiodental,  dental,
alveolar, palatal, and velar fricatives were extracted from a speaking task from
typically speaking female adult speakers (25 Cypriot Greek and 20 Athenian Greek
speakers).  Measures were made of  spectral properties, using a spectral moments
analysis.  The formants  of the following vowel were measured  and second degree
polynomials of the  formant contours were calculated.  The  findings showed that
Athenian Greek  and Cypriot Greek  fricatives differ in all  spectral properties
across  all  places  of  articulation.  Also,  the  co-articulatory  effects  of
fricatives  on  following  vowel  were   different  depending  on  the  dialect.
Duration, spectral  moments, and the  starting frequencies of $F1$,  $F2$, $F3$,
and $F4$ contributed the most to  the classification of dialect.  These findings
provide a solid evidence base for  the manifestation of dialectal information in
the acoustic structure of fricatives.}
