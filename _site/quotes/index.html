        var quotecount = quote_text.length;
        quote_text[0] = "<i>“Thank you for visiting my website.”</i><br><br>Charalambos K. Themistocleous";

        quote_text[1] = "<i>“Πάντες ἄνθρωποι τοῦ εἰδέναι ὀρέγονται φύσει”.<br>“All people naturally desire knowledge.”</i><br><br>Aristotle. Metaphysics 980a 228";

        quote_text[2] = "Bernard Russel recalling an episode from the first day of his imprisonment due to his pacifist, antiwar activities:<br><i>“I was much cheered, on my arrival, by the warder at the gate, who had to take particulars about me. He asked my religion and I replied 'agnostic'. He asked how to spell it, and remarked with a sigh: 'Well, there are many religions, but I suppose they all worship the same God.' This remark kept me cheerful for about a week.”</i><br><br>Russell Bernard (1998). Autobiography. Routledge, p. 257";

        quote_text[3] = "<i>“χρὴ γὰρ εὖ μάλα πολλῶν ἵστορας φιλοσόφους ἄνδρας εἶναι καθ' Ἡράκλειτον.” <br>“According to Heraclitus, those who seek the truth should know many things.”</i> (translated by C.Themistocleous)<br><br>Heraclitus";

        quote_text[4] = "<i>“A salient characteristic of humankind is our guest for truth. When we are free from necessary care and labor, we long to see, hear, and learn, and we regard knowledge of hidden and marvelous matters as essential to a happy life. From this, we understand that what is true, simple and uncorrupted is best suited to human nature. In addition to our longing to see the truth, there is a certain desire for primacy, which explains why a soul well formed by nature will not defer to anyone except guides, teachers, and those who give others justly, legitimately and for the general advantage.”</i><br><br>Marcus Tullius Cicero (2012). On Living and Dying Well. Translated with an Introduction and Notes by Thomas Habinek. Routledge, p. 114";

        quote_text[5] = "<i>“ἐὰν μὴ ἔλπηται ἀνέλπιστον ούκ έξευρήσει, ανεξερεύνητον ἐὸν καὶ ἄπορον.”<br>“If you do not expect the unexpected, you will not find it, as it is challenging to investigate and transcend.”</i> (translated by C.Themistocleous)<br><br>Heraclitus. Fragment 35";

        quote_text[6] = "<i>“Ad astra per aspera”<br>“To the stars, through hardships”</i>";

        quote_text[7] = "<i>“Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind. These passions, like great winds, have blown me hither and thither, in a wayward course, over a great ocean of anguish, reaching to the very verge of despair.” </i><br><br>Russell Bernard (1998). Autobiography. Routledge, p. 9";

        quote_text[8] = "<i>“Rationem vero harum gravitatis proprietatum ex phaenomenis nondum potui deducere, & hypotheses non fingo. Quicquid enim ex phaenomenis non educitur, hypothesis vocanda est; & hypotheses seu metaphysicae, seu physicae, seu qualitatum occultarum, seu mechanicae, in philosophia experimentali locum non habent.” </i><br><br> Isaac Newton (1713). Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, Secunda Editio.";

        quote_text[9] = "<i>“But I shall certainly admit a system as empirical or scientific only if it is capable of being tested by experience. These considerations suggest that not the verifiability but the falsifiability of a system is to be taken as criterion of demarcation.” </i><br><br> Popper Karl (1992). The Logic of Scientific Discovery. London: Routledge, p. 18.";

        quote_text[10] = "<i>“A 'system of elements' – a definition of segments by which the resemblances and differences can be shown, the types of variation by which those segments can be affected, and, lastly, the threshold above which there is a difference and below which there is a similitude – is indispensable for the establishment of even the simplest form of order.” </i><br><br>Michel Foucault (1966). The Order of Τhings.";
        
        quote_text[11] = "<i>Semantics vs. Expression (from exchange between Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson): “How in the world did you deduce that?” I asked. <br> - “Deduce what?” said he, petulantly. <br> - “Why, that he was a retired sergeant of Marines.” <br> – “I have no time for trifles,” he answered, brusquely; then with a smile, “Excuse my rudeness. You broke the thread of my thoughts; but perhaps it is as well. So you actually were not able to see that that man was a sergeant of Marines?” <br> – “No, indeed.” <br>  – “<strong>It was easier to know it than to explain why I knew it.</strong> If you were asked to prove that two and two made four, you might find some difficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact. Even across the street I could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the fellow’s hand. That smacked of the sea. He had a military carriage, however, and regulation side whiskers. There we have the marine. He was a man with some amount of self-importance and a certain air of command. You must have observed the way in which he held his head and swung his cane. A steady, respectable, middle-aged man, too, on the face of him – all facts which led me to believe that he had been a sergeant.” </i><br><br>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1887). A Study in Scarlet."
