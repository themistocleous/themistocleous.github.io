ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE VASCULAR DEMENTIA PARKINSON’S DISEASE FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA MIXED DEMENTIA LANGUAGE SYMPTOMSLanguage symptoms depend on the type of dementia.Individuals with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) constitute the larger group of individuals with dementia. They are characterized by a progressive deterioration of memory, language, conversation, and ability to perform everyday activities.Individuals with Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA), a progressive neurological condition, are impaired in speech and language.Individuals with PPA are grouped into three variants based on their distinct underlying neuropathology and area of brain damage.According to current classification criteria, their characteristic neuropathology and damage patterns give rise to different discourse deficits across three variants, namely in INDIVIDUALS WITH THE NON-FLUENT PPA VARIANT (NFVPPA) INDIVIDUALS WITH THE SEMANTIC PPA VARIANT (SVPPA), AND INDIVIDUALS WITH THE LOGOPENIC PPA VARIANT (LVPPA) Individuals with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) are characterized by a progressive deterioration of movement functioning, which impairs balance, speaking, language, chewing, and swallowing. It impairs speech, language, and communication: Language comprehension Language production of spoken and written language Using language effectively for communication. It involves deficits in one or more language modalities, including phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. It can also impair aspects of functional communication, e.g., Emotions self-monitoring Theory of MindDEMENTIA DIAGNOSISThe neurocognitive assessment aims to evaluate individuals’ condition and provide early diagnosis, prognosis, and quantify intervention efficacy.Computational Language Assessment (CLA) informs the clinician and the patient by quantifying the symptoms of dementia on language and enabling monitoring of disease progression over time.CLA provides tools that can screen individuals for dementia and provide a recommendation on whether to visit a clinician.Although there is no treatment for dementia, pharmaceutical solutions that can potentially that slow down the progression of the disease show positive results and are getting approved.Therefore, early-stage identification, and assessment of individuals with dementia are of utmost importance to enable interventions that can delay the progression of dementia and support family planning.MORE INFORMATION American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA): www.asha.org National Aphasia Association: www.aphasia.org/ Alzheimer’s Association: https://www.alz.org" }, { "title" : "Stuttering", "category" : "", "tags" : " ", "url" : "/research/project/2020/11/04/blog_stuttering.html", "date" : "November 4, 2020", "excerpt" : "Stuttering is a speech disorder characterized by interruptions or disfluencies in verbal expression, where individuals that stutter involuntarily repeat or prolong sounds, syllables, or words.

While technically considered a symptom rather than a disease, the term “stuttering” is often used to denote both the symptom and the disorder.Stuttering typically manifests during childhood, often between the ages of two and five. Many children go through a phase of “developmental stuttering” which is a normal part of language development and usually resolves on its own. However, for some children, stuttering persists and can become a chronic issue.These disruptions are not easily controlled and can be both audible and silent. Stuttering often comes with additional physical movements and negative emotional responses such as fear, embarrassment, or irritation. Specifically, children who stutter may experience long- and short-term consequences:Communication Difficulties: The primary consequence of stuttering is difficulty in fluent communication. This can impact a child’s ability to express their thoughts, needs, and feelings clearly.Emotional and Psychological Impact: Children who stutter may become frustrated or embarrassed about their speech. This can lead to anxiety or decreased self-esteem, especially in social or academic situations. They may also become more reserved, choosing to refrain from speaking in certain situations to avoid stuttering.Social Challenges: Stuttering can affect a child’s social interactions. They may be misunderstood, teased, or bullied, resulting in social isolation.Educational Impact: Stuttering can influence academic performance. Children may avoid participating in classroom discussions, reading aloud, or giving presentations, which could affect their learning and grades.Impact on Future Life: If left unmanaged, stuttering can persist into adulthood, affecting academic, personal, and professional life.

These deficits are often among the first symptoms to emerge, which makes them particularly important for early detection, diagnosis, and treatment planning. Traditional neurological assessments routinely include an evaluation of these functions as they provide critical insights into the progression of neurocognitive diseases. However, traditional speech and language evaluations pose significant challenges for clinicians as they are time-consuming and require substantial resources. In this context, we argue that the use of machine learning methodologies, natural language processing (NLP), and modern artificial intelligence (AI) for Language Assessment represents a significant improvement over conventional manual assessment methods. Open Brain AI aims to help clinicians and researchers employ CLA in their everyday practices.Computational Language Assessment (CLA) leverages these advanced technologies to accomplish three primary goals. First, it enables a comprehensive neuro-cognitive evaluation of speech, language, and communication in elderly and high-risk individuals for dementia. This is crucial as early detection of dementia and other neurocognitive diseases is essential for timely intervention and better patient outcomes. Second, CLA facilitates the diagnosis, prognosis, and assessment of therapy efficacy in at-risk and language-impaired populations. This helps in personalizing treatment plans and monitoring progress over time. Third, it allows easier extensibility to assess patients from a wide range of languages. This is particularly important in a globalized world where patients may speak a variety of languages that are not always comprehensively covered by traditional assessment tools.By employing advanced AI models, CLA can also provide valuable insights into the neurocognitive theory on the relationship between language symptoms and their neural bases. This can help in understanding the underlying mechanisms of language and communication deficits in neurodegenerative diseases and inform the development of more effective interventions.Finally, CLA significantly advances our ability to optimize the prevention and treatment of elderly individuals with communication disorders. This is of utmost importance as communication is a key aspect of social engagement, which in turn is associated with better cognitive and emotional well-being. By improving the assessment and management of communication disorders, CLA can help elderly individuals maintain better social engagement, thereby contributing to healthier aging." }, { "title" : "Aphasia", "category" : "", "tags" : " ", "url" : "/research/project/2020/11/03/blog_aphasia.html", "date" : "November 3, 2020", "excerpt" : "Sickness is an impediment that affects the body not what you choose to do (…) choose to follow this for all the things that happen to you: because you will realize that it impedes something else and not yourself.EpictetusAphasia is a language diso...", "content" : "Sickness is an impediment that affects the body not what you choose to do (…) choose to follow this for all the things that happen to you: because you will realize that it impedes something else and not yourself.EpictetusAphasia is a language disorder affecting a person’s ability to communicate. It is caused by damage to the brain’s language centers, typically resulting from a stroke, brain injury, or neurodegenerative conditions.ASHA defines aphasia as an acquired neurogenic communication disorder that impairs the comprehension and production of spoken and written language and the ability to use language effectively for communication. It involves deficits in one or more language modalities, including phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.Aphasia can manifest in several ways depending on the specific areas of the brain affected and the severity of the impairment. It can impact both expressive language skills (such as speaking and writing) and receptive language skills (such as understanding spoken and written language). The specific symptoms and severity of aphasia can vary widely among individuals.Treatment for aphasia typically involves a comprehensive approach that includes language therapy, communication strategies, and augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) techniques. The goal is to improve communication abilities, enhance quality of life, and help individuals with aphasia participate more fully in social, academic, and vocational activities." }, { "title" : "Assessment", "category" : "", "tags" : " ", "url" : "/2018/09/01/assessment.html", "date" : "September 1, 2018", "excerpt" : "", "content" : "" }, { "title" : "Audiotranscription", "category" : "", "tags" : " ", "url" : "/2018/08/15/audiotranscription.html", "date" : "August 15, 2018", "excerpt" : "", "content" : "" }, { "title" : "Input methods in Emacs", "category" : "", "tags" : " Code, Emacs", "url" : "/emacs,/writing/2017/12/13/emacs-input.html", "date" : "December 13, 2017", "excerpt" : "To access multilingual support in Emacs, one easy way is by typing C-\\ and thenselecting an input method.

Apraxia of Speech (AOS) can also manifest as a symptom of neurodegenerative conditions, particularly in the non-fluent variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia (nfvPPA). In this context, individuals with nfvPPA may display characteristics of AOS, reflecting the underlying neurodegenerative changes that impact the brain&#39;s ability to produce fluent, articulated speech.Individuals with AOS encounter difficulties in articulating what they intend to express accurately and consistently, due to a disruption in the neural pathways responsible for planning motor actions and sequencing the intricate movements involved in speech, such as those required by the tongue, lips, and jaw. Although the individual&#39;s cognitive understanding and intent of speech can be intact, the brain struggles to correctly orchestrate the corresponding physical movements.However, it&#39;s important to distinguish AOS from dysarthria. The latter is a distinct speech disorder resulting from non-cognitive factors, such as muscular weakness or paralysis affecting speech, rather than the planning of movement. While these conditions can coexist in some individuals, complicating the diagnostic process, they are fundamentally different in origin and manifestation.The impact of AOS varies significantly among individuals. In milder cases, it may only affect the pronunciation of a handful of phonemes or multi-syllabic words. In contrast, severe manifestations can result in incomprehensible speech, severely inhibiting effective verbal communication. In those case, AOS necessitates the employment of alternative communication strategies or aids." }, { "title" : "Introduction to Python", "category" : "", "tags" : " ", "url" : "/research/project/2017/05/31/python.html", "date" : "May 31, 2017", "excerpt" : "Charalambos ThemistocleousContents1 Introduction to Python2 Data Manipulation with Pandas2.1 Series2.2 DataFrame2.3 Merging DataFrames2.4 Date and Time2.5 Importing data2.6 Save Data3 Creating Plots4 Basic Descriptive Statistics using PandasIntrod...", "content" : "Charalambos ThemistocleousContents1 Introduction to Python2 Data Manipulation with Pandas2.1 Series2.2 DataFrame2.3 Merging DataFrames2.4 Date and Time2.5 Importing data2.6 Save Data3 Creating Plots4 Basic Descriptive Statistics using PandasIntroduction to PythonThis chapter provides and introduction to Python.

The most important data structure is the DataFrame which isvery similar to R dataframes. Pandas also provide functionality forreshaping, sorting, manipulating, etc., data. The second library we will be using is NumPy, which oﬀers the basicfunctionality for conducting mathematics, including statistics,linear algebra, and Fourier transformations. Matplotlib provides functionality for creating plots and graphs. NLTK is a Natural Language Toolkit implemented in Python. So, to start an analysis add the following code on your code ﬁle.The code imports the libraries and provide a designated name foreach library. So, we will be calling pandas for instance we will usethe name pd followed by a period and the name of a function. Thiswill become more clear soon.**[Python code:1.0.0.] import pandas as pd import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import nltk Data Manipulation with PandasSeriesA Series is a single vector of data with an index for each element.

These two varieties differ most significantly in their consonants, but it is very difficult to perceive differences in the vowels. Young—between 18–23—Athenian and Nicosian speakers participated in the study. The results demonstrate gradi- ent effects of vowel variation and change on vowel acoustic properties: vowel duration, articulatory space, and formant dynamics. I argue that their variation is best understood with respect to Greek vowel raising and vowel reduction, and suggest that vowel variation in Greek applies on specific subsystems (unstressed vowels vary significantly between the two varieties whereas stressed vowels display only minor differences). The findings appear to be the first to gather and compare acoustic material from urban Standard Modern Greek (SMG) and Cypriot Greek (CG) vowels in a unified manner. The implications of these findings for studies on language variation, language change, and language pathology are also discussed.Date: 2/18/2016Time: 1:15 PM – 3:00 PMCategories: HumanitiesOrganizer: Centre for Language Technology, GothenburgLocation: Seminar Room, Dicksongatan 4" }, { "title" : "Academy of Athens: The Utilitarian dictionary of Modern Greek", "category" : "", "tags" : " ", "url" : "/research/project/2014/12/31/Utilitarian_Dictionary.html", "date" : "December 31, 2014", "excerpt" : "The Utilitarian dictionary of Modern Greek Language is one of the most important dictionaries of Modern Greek to this day.

ISBN:978-960-508-187-4. This book is an introduction to experimental methodology and statistics using R and aims: to present the basic principles of experimental methodology and experimental design. to introduce statistics and their application to language problems. to introduce R, a programming language with specialized functions for statistical analysis. The experimental methodology concerns the systematic and organized examination of a research object. The research begins with identifying a problem, the definition of the more specific research questions, and the formulation of specific experimental hypotheses. In this book, we examine how statistical analysis works, the theoretical principles that govern it, and how it relates to experimental methodology. The book aims twofold to teach how statistical tests are performed and present the reasoning that regulates them. Therefore, an attempt was made to make this book as pedagogical and easy to use as possible. Examples based on linguistics and language research have been used for this purpose.

Language variation often occurs below speakers&#39; conscious awareness (Labov, 1994). Determining how dialects affect speech can quantify language variation and change and enable individualized solutions in speech and language pathology.Aim 1. Determining the effects of language variation on speech productionTo determine how language varieties are encoded in the acoustic structure of vowels and consonants, I have collected acoustic data from Standard Modern Greek and Cypriot Greek using a controlled experimental design. The experiments took place in Greece and Cyprus between 20112012, and the corpus collected is the most extensive corpus on Greek sound productions to this day. In two studies published in Phonetica and Speech Communication, I provided an account of the acoustic and phonemic properties of Standard Modern Greek and Cypriot Greek vowel systems. Also, I showed how stress and dialects influence the formant frequencies of vowels and their temporal properties (Themistocleous 2017a, 2017b). Furthermore, in Themistocleous (2017b), I show that higherorder formant frequencies (e.g., F4 and F5) and formant dynamics (i.e., the change of formant frequencies in time) convey phonemic and dialectal information. In the same paper, I provide a machine learning model that can automatically identify dialects from vowel spectral properties with high accuracy and, at the same time, quantify the contributions of their acoustic properties. Moreover, I have employed a multifactorial approach that combines machine learning and statistical modeling to determine consonants&#39; temporal, spectral, dynamic, and coarticulatory properties: stops (e.g., /p, t, k/), fricatives (e.g., /f, θ, x/), and sonorants (e.g., /m, n, l, r/) (Themistocleous 2017, Themistocleous 2020). In these studies, I have demonstrated that phonemic and varietal information are encoded simultaneously at the phonemic and subphonemic levels and showed that even the tiniest segments of speech, such as the bursts of stop consonants, can convey sociolinguistic information (Themistocleous 2016). The methods from signal processing and machine learning can be applied to study the physiological, sociolinguistic, and emotional information encoded in speech productions of languages with dialectal variation, such as American English.Aim 2. To provide machine learning models that identify dialects from vowels and consonants.During spoken communication, the fine acoustic properties of speech sounds can reveal vital sociolinguistic information about speakers and can function as reliable identification markers of speakers&#39; identity. Acoustic sounds reveal the dialect of speakers. The development of automatic identification models of dialects based on information from individualized sounds can quantify how languages vary and change and can enable individualized solutions with practical applications as diagnostic tools in language pathology. I am analyzing the acoustic properties of speech sounds, such as the duration, the frequencies of vowels, and sonorants, and I employ stateof-the-art machine learning models (e.g., Deep Neural Networks) to identify dialects from just one vowel or one consonant with high classification accuracy. The payback to developing intelligent generalpurpose models for identifying dialects from speech using machine learning is that models can identify speakers&#39; identities from small segments of speech, which can inform theoretical models of conversation, language change, and language variation.Papers with CodeIdentification of speakers&#39; dialect from vowels (Themistocleous, 2017a), fricatives (Themistocleous, 2017b; Themistocleous, Savva, &amp;amp; Aristodemou, 2016), stops (Themistocleous, 2016a), and sonorants (Themistocleous, 2019; Themistocleous, Fyndanis, Tsapkini, 2022). Themistocleous Charalambos (2019). Dialect Classification from a Single Sonorant Sound Using Deep Neural Networks. doi: 10.3389/fneur.2018.00975. Listeners do not require long productions of speech to identify the accent of a speaker, often a single sound suffices. This study shows that using machine learning and information from a speech segment, namely a single sonorant sound /m n l r/, it is possible to distinguish two dialects of Greek: Athenian Greek and Cypriot Greek. In our future research, we will be exploring further this approach to identify medical conditions that influence speech production.

Speech Communication 94, 13 -22. This study provides a classification model of two Modern Greek dialects, namely Athenian Greek and Cypriot Greek, using information from speech. To this end, a large corpus of vowels from 45 speakers of Athenian Greek and Cypriot Greek was collected. The findings show that duration and the zeroth coefficient of F2, F3 and F4 contribute more to the classification of the dialect than the other measurements; it also shows that formant dynamics are important for the classification of dialect.Link to the paper: [PDF] Themistocleous Charalambos (2017). The Nature of Phonetic Gradience across a Dialect Continuum: Evidence from Modern Greek Vowels. Phonetica 74, 157–172. This study investigates the acoustic properties of vowels in Athenian Greek (AG) and Cypriot Greek. The findings show that (1) stressed vowels are more peripheral than unstressed vowels, (2) AG unstressed /i a u/ vowels are more raised than the corresponding CG vowels, (3) AG unstressed vowels are shorter than CG unstressed vowels, and (4) AG /i·u/ are more rounded than the corresponding CG vowels.Link to the paper: [PDF] Themistocleous Charalambos (2017).

The central thesis of this paper is that cross-dialectal studies of fricative&#39;s acoustic structure can reveal patterns that designate speakers of different dialectal groups. The findings provide a solid evidence base for the manifestation of dialectal information in the acoustic structure of fricatives. Frontiers 2017 Version: [PDF] Themistocleous Charalambos (2016). The bursts of stops can convey dialectal information. Journal of the Acoustical Society of America EL 140(4), EL334–EL340.This study investigates the effects of the dialect of the speaker on the spectral properties of stop bursts. Forty-five female speakers—20 Standard Modern Greek and 25 Cypriot Greek speak- ers—participated in this study. The spectral properties of stop bursts were calculated from the burst spectra and analyzed using spectral moments. The findings show that besides linguistic information, i.e., the place of articulation and the stress, the speech signals of bursts can encode social information, i.e., the dialects. A classification model using decision trees showed that skewness and standard deviation have a major contribution for the classification of bursts across dialects.

Linguistic prosody manifests meanings, such as new and old information, designates the boundaries of phrases and utterances, and expresses questions, commands, and statements using different melodic patterns. In conversations, prosody is a cue for allocating turns (e.g., turn continuation, turn completion, etc.). Non-linguistic prosody manifests emotional or affective information (excitement, sadness, etc.) and other physiological information (e.g., gender, age, and body size). The project aims to determine the effects of information structure on prosody and model how prosody (we studied mainly pitch accents and duration) realizes focus, contrast, and topics in two dialects of Greek, Standard Modern Greek, and Cypriot Greek.This research was part of my Ph.D. project. I have investigated the prosodic manifestation of linguistic prominence and showed that tone alignment with segments, pitch range, and syllable duration manifest crossdialectal types of information focus, topics, and contrast (e.g., Themistocleous 2011; Themistocleous 2016). In Themistocleous (2014), I specified how tones and final lengthening interact with syllable structure to mark the boundaries of phrases. The study provided evidence for two diverse sources that explain **final lengthening**: the tonal lengthening and the boundary lengthening. In a subsequent study, I had evaluated three hypotheses concerning the alignment of melodic tones with the segmental structure. The hypotheses postulate that tones align to specific *anchors* or keep an invariant distance between each other. The study cast doubt on these accounts and challenged existing timing criteria that determine pitch accents as phonological units. Moreover, it proposed a new account for tonal alignment that postulates that tones align within a specific range, namely an anchorage, instead of a particular anchoring point, which I called “the anchorage hypothesis” (Themistocleous 2016). The findings also laid the groundwork for a computational model of speech prosody based on neural networks (see Berndardi and Themistocleous 2017).Gaining insight into how prosody is produced and perceived is of utmost importance for addressing essential issues about speech production. Such information would have realworld importance in explaining how temporal and frequency information is parsed in the brain. Further research on prosody can have significant applications in language disorders, such as aprosodia and aphasia.Papers with CodeThemistocleousCharalambos (2016). Seeking an anchorage: Evidence from the tonal alignment ofthe Cypriot Greek prenuclear pitch accent. Language and Speech, 59(4):433–461.By exploringthe timing of the Cypriot Greek L*+H prenuclear pitch accent, this study tested the predictions ofthree hypotheses about tonal alignment: the invariance hypothesis, the segmental anchoringhypothesis, and the segmental anchorage hypothesis. The findings on the alignment of the high tone(H) are both intriguing and unexpected: the alignment of the H depends on the number of unstressedsyllables that follow the prenuclear pitch accent. The `wandering&#39; of the H over multiple syllablesis extremely rare among languages, and casts doubt on the invariance hypothesis and the segmentalanchoring hypothesis, as well as indicating the need for a modified version of the segmentalanchorage hypothesis. To address the alignment of the H, we suggest that it aligns within asegmental anchorage–the area that follows the prenuclear pitch accent–in such a way as to protectthe paradigmatic contrast between the L*+H prenuclear pitch accent and the L+H* nuclear pitchaccent.Link to the Language and Speech paper: [PDF]Themistocleous Charalambos (2014). Edge-Tone Effects and Prosodic Domain Effects on Final Lengthening.Linguistic Variation 14(1). 129–160This study reports two experiments that investigate theedge-tones and domain-specific effects on final lengthening. The study shows that in Cypriot Greekthe following occur: (a) lengthening applies primarily on the syllable nucleus not the syllableonset, which suggests variety specific effects of lengthening; (b) lengthening depends on theedge-tones, namely, polar questions trigger more lengthening than statements and wh-questions; (c)lengthening provides support for at least two distinct prosodic domains over the phonological word,the intonational phrase and the intermediate phrase; greater lengthening associates with the firstand shorter lengthening with the latter; (d) finally, syllable duration depends on the syllabledistance from the boundary. By pointing to the distinct lengthening effects of edge-tones anddomain-boundaries, the aforementioned findings highlight the application of different lengtheningdevices.Link to the PDF paper: [PDF]ReferencesThemistocleous Charalambos (2016).

The performance of the DNN was compared to the classification accuracy of Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Decision Trees, as well as to expert clinicians’ classifications.ResultsThe DNN model outperformed the other machine learning models as well as expert clinicians’ classifications with 80% classification accuracy. Importantly, 90% of patients with nfvPPA and 95% of patients with lvPPA was identified correctly, providing reliable subtyping of these patients into their corresponding PPA variants.Conclusion We show that the combined speech and language markers from connected speech productions can identify patients with dementia from healthy controls and inform variant subtyping in patients with PPA. The end-to-end automated machine learning approach we present can enable clinicians and researchers to provide an easy, quick, and inexpensive classification of patients with PPA.Papers with CodeThemistocleousCharalambos, Bronte Ficek, Kimberly Webster, Dirk-Bart den Ouden, Argye E.Hillis, Kyrana Tsapkini (2021).

Frontiers in Neurology. doi: 10.3389/fneur.2018.00975.To this day,there is no cure for dementia but early-stage treatment can delay the progression of MCI; thus, thedevelopment of valid tools for identifying early cognitive changes is of great importance. In thisstudy, we provide an automated machine learning method, using Deep Neural Network Architectures,that aims to identify MCI. The Deep Neural Network Architecture proposed here constitutes a methodthat contributes to the early diagnosis of cognitive decline, quantifies the progression of thecondition, and enables suitable therapeutics.Frontiers in Neurology 2018 version: [PDF]Link to GitHub page with source code: [CODE]" } , {} ]
