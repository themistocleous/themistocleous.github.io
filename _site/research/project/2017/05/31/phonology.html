<p>Current phonological models aim to determine the
structure of the <em>linguistic</em> representation of speech melody. These models
capture aspects of speech melody related to linguistic prominence (a.k.a.,
tonicity), phrasing (a.k.a., tonality), and tune (questions, statements,
commands etc.). The sociolinguistic and interactional aspects that speech
melody conveys are considered <em>non-linguistic</em> which is another way to say
that they are outside the scope of phonological analysis. Even though this
distinction has served the purposes of phonological theory, it does not capture
all information encoded in speech signals during communication. In several
works, my aim is to determine the linguistic and non-linguistic factors that
influence prosodic production and its manifestation in speech signals.</p>

<p>In my PhD thesis (Themistocleous, 2011), I provided the first description of
Cypriot Greek pitch accents and compared their production with those of Standard
Modern Greek/Athenian Greek. An important contribution of the thesis is that it
determines the effects of dialect on pitch accent production and perception. The
two dialects differ in the alignment and pitch range of pitch accents, which
result in dialectal differences in the realization of new information focus,
contrastive focus, and contrastive topic. The thesis provides a linguistic model
of the interface of prosody and information structure that captures the prosodic
manifestation of information structure categories in Standard Modern Greek and
Cypriot Greek prosody.</p>

<p>A follow-up study explored a long-standing problem in the phonology of prosody,
namely how pitch accents align with respect to vowels and consonants. This
problem is important as its answer determines how we define pitch accents as
tonal units. Several hypotheses have been proposed that aimed to determine the
timing of pitch accents with the segmental structure. In an article, which has
been published in <em>Language and Speech</em> (Themistocleous 2016), I
investigated the predictions of three hypotheses of Autosegmental Metrical (AM)
Phonology, namely those of the <em>invariance hypothesis</em>, the <em>segmental
anchoring hypothesis</em>, and the <em>segmental anchorage hypothesis</em>. I
conducted two experiments: in the first, I manipulated the syllable patterns of
the stressed syllable and in the second, I modified the distance (in number of
syllables from one to six) of the prenuclear low and high (L<em>+H) pitch accent
from the following pitch accent. The findings on the alignment of the low tone
(L) corroborate the predictions of the *segmental anchoring hypothesis</em>:
the L persistently aligns inside the onset consonant, a few milliseconds before
the stressed vowel. However, one unanticipated finding was that the alignment of
the H depends on the number of unstressed syllables that follow the prenuclear
pitch accent. What is important is that the ``wandering’’ of the H over multiple
syllables is extremely rare among languages. This finding casts doubt on the
<em>invariance hypothesis</em> and the <em>segmental anchoring hypothesis</em>, as
well as indicating the need for a modified version of the <em>segmental
anchorage hypothesis</em>. To address the alignment of the H, I suggested that the H
aligns within a segmental anchorage–the area that follows the prenuclear pitch
accent–in such a way as to preserve the paradigmatic contrast between the L<em>+H
prenuclear pitch accent and the L+H</em> nuclear pitch accent.</p>

<p>The findings of this article make an important contribution to the field, as
they challenge the existing timing criteria that determine pitch accents as
phonological units. This combination of findings—along with the lingering
issue of phonological descriptions that they do not capture non-linguistic
meanings—gave support to a distinct approach of tonal structure.
Specifically, in a current study presented in <em>Exling 2017</em>, we provided a
classification model of prosodic F0 contours of questions and statements
(Bernardi and Themistocleous 2017) using state-of-the-art classification models
based on two deep neural network architectures: a convolutional neural network
(ConvNet) and a Long Short-Term memory (LSTM) neural network. We showed that
ConvNets outperform LSTMs in learning and classifying polar questions and
statements. The classification resulted in 96% accuracy, which is an extremely
high classification accuracy. Essentially, the neural network learns the
important patterns from the structure of $F0$ contours that enable the neural
network to classify questions and statements. This line of research has the
potential of capturing more information about prosody than any other current
approach of prosodic structure, it can take into consideration global and local
aspects of the $F0$ contour (that may or may not correspond to what
phonological theories identify as pitch accents and boundary tones), and can
capture both linguistic and non-linguistic meanings conveyed by speech melody.
I believe that this line of research, using deep neural network architectures
can potentially open new horizons towards understanding the relationship
between speech production and meaning.</p>

<p>The temporal aspects of the utterance constitute another aspect of prosody.
Especially, final lengthening can shed light on the hierarchy of prosodic
domains and on the turn-taking exchanges. Higher order prosodic domains—such
as the intonational phrase and the intermediate phase—are marked with greater
final lengthening than lower order prosodic domains, such as the phonological
word. In my MA thesis (Themistocleous 2008), I explored final lengthening and
showed that differences in the duration of final lengthening depend on the
prosodic structure of the utterance and on the dialect of the speaker. I
explored this issue further in a study which was published in <em>Linguistic
Variation</em> (Themistocleous, 2014). Specifically, in that study, I conducted two
experiments that investigate the interaction of edge-tones and final
lengthening.</p>

<p>The study showed that in Cypriot Greek the following occur: (a) lengthening
applies primarily on the syllable nucleus not on the syllable onset; (b)
lengthening depends on the edge-tones, namely, polar questions trigger more
lengthening than statements, and wh-questions; (c) lengthening provides support
for at least two distinct prosodic domains over the phonological word: the
intonational phrase and the intermediate phrase, greater lengthening associates
with the first and shorter lengthening with the latter; (d) finally, syllable
duration depends on the syllable distance from the boundary, i.e., lengthening
applies locally on penultimate and ultimate syllables whereas antepenultimates
are affected the least. An important finding of this study is that by pointing
to the distinct lengthening effects of edge-tones and domain-boundaries, it
provides evidence for two different sources of final lengthening: tonal
lengthening and domain specific lengthening. This research on prosody is an
ongoing one. Currently, I explore the relationship of prosody and turn-taking in
conversations (see also my early studies: Themistocleous 2007, Botinis, Bakakou,
Themistocleous 2007).</p>
