    <p>\textbf<em>\textsc</em>Vowels and Consonants** The past sixty years have seen
increasingly rapid advances in the field of phonetics and speech acoustics,
which established the acoustic properties of vowels and consonants. Many
studies within this research paradigm were guided primarily by the urge to
identify the invariant features of speech that realize speech sounds. The
invariant features were considered as the ``actual’’ properties of vowels and
consonants whereas the non-invariant features were thought to be insignificant.
For instance, vowels were identified by the first two—and in some cases
three—formant frequencies, which were measured once in the middle of each
formant frequency. Along with this line of research, however, there has been an
increasing interest over the effects of factors, such as speaker physiology,
sociolinguistic properties, emotional state etc. on the acoustic structure of
vowels and consonants. Following this line of research, in a number of studies,
I attempt to determine how vowel and consonant spectra convey both linguistic
and non-linguistic information. To understand these patterns, I employ methods
from signal processing and machine learning. Especially, I am extremely
interested in machine learning methods, such as deep Neural Networks, SVMs,
HMMs, which are behind current impressive achievements in text-to-speech,
speech perception, machine translation, image description generation, and
semantic interpretation. I believe that these methods can offer insights into
human perception and cognition including the processing and accessing
information.</p>

<p>Specifically, in an article, which has been published in <em>Speech
Communication</em> (Themistocleous, 2017), I provide a classification model of two
Modern Greek dialects, namely Athenian Greek and Cypriot Greek, using
information from formant dynamics of $F1, F2, F3, F4$ and vowel duration. The
measurements were employed in classification experiments, using three
classifiers: Linear Discriminant Analysis, Flexible Discriminant Analysis, and
C5.0. The latter outperformed the other classification models, resulting in a
higher classification accuracy of dialects, namely Athenian Greek and Cypriot
Greek. C5.0 classification shows that the duration and the zeroth coefficient of
$F2$, $F3$, and $F4$ contribute more to the classification of the dialect than
the other measurements; it also shows that formant dynamics are important for
the classification of dialect. An important contribution of this work is that it
demonstrates how acoustic properties are fined-tuned to convey both linguistic
and non-linguistic information.</p>

<p>In an article, which was published in <em>Phonetica</em> (Themistocleous 2017b),
I investigated the acoustic properties of vowels of Standard Modern Greek (SMG)
and Cypriot Greek (CG). The study shows that the two varieties differ in their
vowels. The findings show that Greek stressed vowels are more peripheral than
unstressed vowels, (2) SMG unstressed /i u/ vowels are more raised than CG
vowels, (3) SMG unstressed vowels are shorter than CG unstressed vowels, and
(4) SMG /i o u/ are more rounded than the corresponding CG vowels. Moreover, it
shows that variation applies to specific subsystems, as it is the unstressed
vowels depending on the dialect whereas the stressed vowels display only minor
differences between varieties. The sociolinguistic implications of these
findings with respect to vowel raising and vowel reduction are discussed in the
paper. That study is the first to provide acoustic evidence of Cypriot Greek
vowels and the first to provide acoustic evidence on the sociophonetic
differences of southern Greek dialects.</p>

<p>\begin<em>figure</em>

Mean relative positions of SMG and CG vowels in the F1
 x F2 plane and their formant movement measured at seven equidistant
 points (20-30-40-50-60-70-80\%) across the vowel. Shown are stressed and
 unstressed variants. Arrows are located at the 80\%-point of the formant
 movement.</p>

<p>In a follow up article to Phonetica (submitted). I am exploring the dynamics of
vowel formants and how they change during articulation. The findings from vowel
dynamics are impressive as they show that although Modern Greek vowels are
considered relatively monothoptongal, their formants change during articulation
significantly (see Figure \ref<em>dynamics</em>). Low and middle vowels shift from low to high; the
high vowel [i] remains relatively static and the vowel [u] becomes more fronted.
Most importantly vowel quality, stress, and dialect affect significantly formant
dynamics. The study argues that the dynamic approaches can constitute a
significant methodological improvement over static approaches of vowels.</p>

<p>In an article published in the <em>Journal of the Acoustical Society of
America</em>, I investigated the effects of dialect on the spectral properties of
stop bursts. An impressing finding is that besides linguistic information,
i.e., the place of articulation and the stress, bursts, which are extremely
short segments of speech, can also encode dialectal information. A
classification model using decision trees showed that skewness and standard
deviation enable the classification of bursts across dialects.</p>

<p><a href="\img\img_papers\a.jpg">vowel</a>
Coarticulatory effects of Cypriot Greek fricatives  on the F1
 and F2 of the following vowel.</p>

<p>Several studies have explored the acoustic structure of fricatives, yet there
has very little acoustic research on the effects of dialects on the production
of fricatives. In an article that was submitted this June (June 2017) at the
<em>Frontiers of Psychology</em>, I investigate the effects dialect on the
temporal, spectral, and coarticulatory properties of fricatives and aim to
determine the acoustic properties that convey information about the dialect
(Athenian Greek and Cypriot Greek). Productions of voiced and voiceless
labiodental, dental, alveolar, palatal, and velar fricatives were extracted from
a speaking task from typically speaking female adult speakers (25 Cypriot Greek
and 20 Athenian Greek speakers). Measures were made of spectral properties,
using a spectral moments analysis. The formants of the following vowel were
measured and second degree polynomials of the formant contours were calculated.
The findings show that the two dialects differed in their alveolar fricatives.
Duration, spectral moments, and the starting frequencies of $F1$, $F2$, $F3$,
and $F4$ contributed the most to the classification of dialect. The measures
showed effects of the dialect on the acoustic structure of fricatives and on the
coarticulation of fricatives with the following vowel. These findings provide a
solid evidence base for the manifestation of dialect information in the acoustic
structure of fricatives. The study argues that these patterns of features
provide the foundation for the emergence of sociophonetic shibboleths
distinguishing the speakers of one variety from the speakers of another variety.</p>
