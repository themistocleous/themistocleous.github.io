        In this paper, we present a machine learning model based on deep neural networks (DNN) for the subtyping of patients with PPA into three main variants, using combined acoustic and linguistic information elicited automatically. The end-to-end automated machine learning approach we present can enable clinicians and researchers to provide an easy, quick, and inexpensive classification of patients with PPA.<p></p>

        Listeners do not require long productions of speech to identify the accent of a speaker, often a single sound suffices. This study shows that using machine learning and information from a speech segment, namely a single sonorant sound /m n l r/, it is possible to distinguish two dialects of Greek: Athenian Greek and Cypriot Greek. In our future research, we will be exploring further this approach to identify medical conditions that influence speech production.<p></p>

In this study, we provide an automated machine learning method, using Deep Neural Network Architectures, that aims to identify MCI.

    <p></p>This study provides a classification model of two Modern Greek dialects, namely Athenian Greek and Cypriot Greek, using information from speech. To this end, a large corpus of vowels from 45 speakers of Athenian Greek and Cypriot Greek was collected. The findings show that duration and the zeroth coefficient of F2, F3 and F4 contribute more to the classification of the dialect than the other measurements; it also shows that formant dynamics are important for the classification of dialect.<p></p>Link to the paper: <a href="/assets/papers/frontiers.pdf"><b>[PDF]</b></a></td>

The C5.0 machine-learning algorithm was employed to model the interaction of sociolinguistic factors on the development of clitic placement in bidialectal children. The model shows that speakers acquire the relevant features very early, yet compartmentalization of form and function according to style emerges only as they engage in the larger speech community. <p></p>Frontiers 2017 Version: <a href="/assets/papers/fcomm.pdf"><b>[PDF]</b></a></td>

Journal of the Acoustical Society of America EL 140(4), EL334–EL340.<p></p>This study investigates the effects of the dialect of the speaker on the spectral properties of stop bursts. Forty-five female speakers—20 Standard Modern Greek and 25 Cypriot Greek speak- ers—participated in this study. The spectral properties of stop bursts were calculated from the burst spectra and analyzed using spectral moments. The findings show that besides linguistic information, i.e., the place of articulation and the stress, the speech signals of bursts can encode social information, i.e., the dialects. A classification model using decision trees showed that skewness and standard deviation have a major contribution for the classification of bursts across dialects.<p></p>

Seeking an anchorage: Evidence from the tonal alignment of the Cypriot Greek prenuclear pitch accent. Language and Speech, 59(4):433–461.<p></p>By exploring the timing of the Cypriot Greek L*+H prenuclear pitch accent, this study tested the predictions of three hypotheses about tonal alignment: the invariance hypothesis, the segmental anchoring hypothesis, and the segmental anchorage hypothesis. The findings on the alignment of the high tone (H) are both intriguing and unexpected: the alignment of the H depends on the number of unstressed syllables that follow the prenuclear pitch accent. The `wandering' of the H over multiple syllables is extremely rare among languages, and casts doubt on the invariance hypothesis and the segmental anchoring hypothesis, as well as indicating the need for a modified version of the segmental anchorage hypothesis. To address the alignment of the H, we suggest that it aligns within a segmental anchorage–the area that follows the prenuclear pitch accent–in such a way as to protect the paradigmatic contrast between the L*+H prenuclear pitch accent and the L+H* nuclear pitch accent.<p></p>

The study shows that in Cypriot Greek the following occur: (a) lengthening applies primarily on the syllable nucleus not the syllable onset, which suggests variety specific effects of lengthening; (b) lengthening depends on the edge-tones, namely, polar questions trigger more lengthening than statements and wh-questions; (c) lengthening provides support for at least two distinct prosodic domains over the phonological word, the intonational phrase and the intermediate phrase; greater lengthening associates with the first and shorter lengthening with the latter; (d) finally, syllable duration depends on the syllable distance from the boundary. By pointing to the distinct lengthening effects of edge-tones and domain-boundaries, the aforementioned findings highlight the application of different lengthening devices.<p></p>Link to the PDF paper: <a href="/assets/papers/lengthening.pdf"><b>[PDF]</b></a></td>
