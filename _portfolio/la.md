Communication</em>.<p></p>
The C5.0 machine-learning algorithm was employed to model the interaction of sociolinguistic factors
on the development of clitic placement in bidialectal children. The model shows that speakers
acquire the relevant features very early, yet compartmentalization of form and function according to
style emerges only as they engage in the larger speech community. <p></p>Frontiers 2017 Version: <a
