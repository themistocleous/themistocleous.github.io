Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a progressive
decline of language functions. Its symptoms are grouped into three PPA variants: nonfluent PPA,
logopenic PPA, and semantic PPA. Grammatical deficiencies differ depending on the PPA variant.<br>
Using an automated analysis of a short picture description task, this study showed that content
versus function words can distinguish patients with nonfluent PPA, semantic PPA, and logopenic PPA
variants. Verbs were less important as distinguishing features of patients with different PPA
variants than earlier thought. Finally, the study showed that among the most important
distinguishing features of PPA variants were elaborative speech elements, such as adjectives and
adverbs.<br>
