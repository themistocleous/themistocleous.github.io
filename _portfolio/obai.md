Open Brain AI (http://openbrainai.com) is a computational platform (formerly Themis) that aims to automate multilingual speech, language, and communication analysis and transcription, and support researchers and clinicians by automating tasks allowing them to focus on tasks that matter. 

Open Brain AI performs in-depth discourse analysis by using advanced AI techniques like large language models, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning. This includes accurate grammar annotation, comprehensive lexical analysis, phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics evaluations. Researchers, clinicians, and educators studying the idiosyncratic characteristics of human language benefit significantly from this platform. 

Open Brain AI integrates within the evolving NLP and Computational Linguistics landscape. It fosters insightful connections between automated evaluations and language learning in classrooms while offering possibilities for identifying cognitive indicators in speech and language disorders. Open Brain AI currently supports English, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish analysis.

<p></p>These two tools enable the automatic scoring of phonology and of spelling performance. They
run on Terminal. To download these apps visit:

<td style="border-"><strong>Word Repetition App </strong>
<p>Word Repetition App is employed by clinicians to test ST memory. The application plays a lists of
sounds of semantically related words (clothes, appliances, etc.) and asks the participant to
repeat these sounds. During the repetition phase the software records the production. The
process repeats five times except if the clinician decides to modify the number of repetitions.

<td style="border-"><strong>Word Repetition Span App </strong>
<p> Word Repetition Span task may consist of word repetition or non-word repetition. Both spans
begin at List length 2 and ceiling at List length 5. For this task, the computer will say a
string of words or non-words for the participant to repeat in order. The clinician then copies
the participant's responses in the order they were offered. This task assesses the ability to
repeat single words and single non-words. Depending on the accuracy and types of errors, it is
sensitive to deficits of input and output processing</p>

<td style="border-"><strong>Phonetics IPA</strong>
<p></p>Phonetics IPA is a platform for the linguistic analysis of texts in a Text-Editor-like
environment. The current version allows users to<p></p>
<ul>
<li>type text in Standard Modern Greek orthography and convert it to IPA.</li>
<li>type text in Cypriot Greek orthography and convert it to IPA.</li>
<li>create lists of words in reverse order for dictionaries.</li>
<li>analyze texts using the implemented regular expressions engine (currently only the windows
version).</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
It was originally written in C# for Microsoft Windows; these versions are not under development any
more. (There is also a newer version written in Python for testing; see details below.)
