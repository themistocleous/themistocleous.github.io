Open Brain AI (http://openbrainai.com) is a computational platform (formerly Themis) that aims to automate multilingual speech, language, and communication analysis and transcription, and support researchers and clinicians by automating tasks allowing them to focus on tasks that matter. 

Open Brain AI performs in-depth discourse analysis by using advanced AI techniques like large language models, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning. This includes accurate grammar annotation, comprehensive lexical analysis, phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics evaluations. Researchers, clinicians, and educators studying the idiosyncratic characteristics of human language benefit significantly from this platform. 

Open Brain AI integrates within the evolving NLP and Computational Linguistics landscape. It fosters insightful connections between automated evaluations and language learning in classrooms while offering possibilities for identifying cognitive indicators in speech and language disorders. Open Brain AI currently supports English, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish analysis.
