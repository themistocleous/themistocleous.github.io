He asked my religion and I replied 'agnostic'. He asked how to spell it, and remarked with a sigh: 'Well, there are many religions, but I suppose they all worship the same God.' This remark kept me cheerful for about a week.”</i><br><br>Russell Bernard (1998). Autobiography. Routledge, p. 257";

When we are free from necessary care and labor, we long to see, hear, and learn, and we regard knowledge of hidden and marvelous matters as essential to a happy life. From this, we understand that what is true, simple and uncorrupted is best suited to human nature. In addition to our longing to see the truth, there is a certain desire for primacy, which explains why a soul well formed by nature will not defer to anyone except guides, teachers, and those who give others justly, legitimately and for the general advantage.”</i><br><br>Marcus Tullius Cicero (2012).

You broke the thread of my thoughts; but perhaps it is as well. So you actually were not able to see that that man was a sergeant of Marines?” <br> – “No, indeed.” <br>  – “<strong>It was easier to know it than to explain why I knew it.</strong> If you were asked to prove that two and two made four, you might find some difficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact. Even across the street I could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the fellow’s hand. That smacked of the sea. He had a military carriage, however, and regulation side whiskers. There we have the marine. He was a man with some amount of self-importance and a certain air of command. You must have observed the way in which he held his head and swung his cane. A steady, respectable, middle-aged man, too, on the face of him – all facts which led me to believe that he had been a sergeant.” </i><br><br>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1887).
