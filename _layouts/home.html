    <p  ><span  style="color:#000000;">  As  of  April  2018  –  I  am
	Postdoctoral Research  Fellow at the Department  of Neurology,
	School   of  Medicine,   <a  href="https://www.jhu.edu/">Johns
	Hopkins  University</a>, Baltimore,  USA.  In  my research,  I
	focus on the  analysis of speech and  language from behavioral
	and   tDCS  interventions   in  participants   with  PPA   and
	Alzheimer’s  disease,  and  on   the  analysis  of  data  from
	language,  cognitive and  quality  of  life evaluations  using
	machine learning and natural language processing.</p>

	<p>As     a      researcher     at     the      Department     of
	Swedish,     <a     href="https://www.gu.se">University     of
	Gothenburg</a>,  Sweden,  my  aim  is  to  identify  important
	linguistic markers in persons with MCI and Alzheimer’s disease
	that  can   be  used   as  complementary,   early  diagnostic,
	prognostic or screening tools  (PI Dr.  Dimitrios Kokkinakis).
	I focus on data from reading tasks, picture description tasks,
	and  speech  interaction,  the latter  continues  my  research
	program at  the Centre  for Linguistic  Theory and  Studies in
	  Probability (CLASP, PI Prof.  Emer.  Shalom Lappin).</p>

	<p>I  am  also  interested   in  developing,  evaluating,  and
	improving natural language processing methods and tools---such
	as   speech   recognition  and   sentence   segmentation---for
	automating the analysis of speech in populations with language
	impairment.</p>

	<p>Previously,          I         was          a         visiting
	scholar at <a href="https://www.princeton.edu">Princeton University</a>,
	and          a          temporary         lecturer          at
	the    <a     href="http://www.ucy.ac.cy/en/">University    of
	Cyprus.</a>

	See                                                       also
