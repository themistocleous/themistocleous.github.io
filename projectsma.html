<h1><strong>Subject: Proposed MA Project: Artificial Intelligence and Speech, Language, and Communication Impairments</strong></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are assembling a dynamic team of talented individuals who share a common interest in exploring novel approaches and leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to address the challenges faced by individuals with developmental or acquired neurocognitive conditions. By combining the power of AI with our deep understanding of language and communication impairments, we aim to push the boundaries of current research and make significant advancements in this field. I am proposing an MA topic that fits our overall research environment well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We will work on the latest technologies in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and AI to identify speech, language, and communication disorder patterns. The overall plan offers a comprehensive set of objectives and research questions. Students can discuss and modify them to fit their research interests. Choosing this project will help students engage with the latest technologies and the future of computational language assessment, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment efficacy assessment. Please reach out to me for more information.</p>
<h2>Title: AI-powered Speech, Language, and Communication Assessment: Unlocking Insights into Developmental and Acquired Communication Challenges</h2>
<img style="width: 50%; text-align: center;float: left" alt="A little AI robot!" src="/img/ai5a.png">
<h3><strong>Research Objectives:</strong></h3>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>To explore AI techniques, such as machine learning and natural language processing, to automatically analyze spoken and written speech productions of individuals with speech, language, and communication disorders caused by neurogenic conditions, whether developmental or acquired.</li>
<li>To compare the performance and reliability of AI-based assessment methods with traditional manual assessment methods regarding accuracy, efficiency, objectivity, and validity.</li>
<li>To investigate the benefits and challenges of using AI-based assessment methods for diagnosis, prognosis, treatment efficacy evaluation, and therapy planning for individuals with speech, language, and communication disorders.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Research Questions:</strong></h3>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>How can AI techniques be applied to speech, language, and communication assessment for individuals with neurogenic conditions?</li>
<li>How do AI-based assessment methods compare with manual assessment methods regarding accuracy, efficiency, objectivity, and validity?</li>
<li>What are the benefits and challenges of using AI-based assessment methods for diagnosis, prognosis, treatment efficacy evaluation, and therapy planning for individuals with speech, language, and communication disorders?</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Research Plan(s):</strong></h3>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Conduct a literature review on the current state-of-the-art AI techniques for speech, language, and communication assessment and the existing challenges and limitations of manual assessment methods.</li>
<li>Develop or adapt AI-based computational applications that can automatically analyze spoken and written speech productions of individuals with speech, language, and communication disorders caused by neurogenic conditions. You can also test Open Brain AI (openbrainai.com), our computational platform that automatically harnesses innovative AI techniques to analyze spoken and written speech productions.</li>
<li>Collect data from individuals with speech, language, and communication disorders caused by neurogenic conditions and from healthy controls. The data should include spoken and written speech productions on various tasks and topics.</li>
<li>Apply the AI-based platform to the data and obtain different assessment results in different granularities, such as pronunciation, fluency, active listening, grammar,
vocabulary,
comprehension,
content quality,
and etiquette.
Compare the results with the manual assessments of trained clinicians or educators using standardized tools or tests.</li>
<li>Evaluate the performance and reliability of the AI-based platform using various metrics
and statistical analyses.
Identify the strengths
and weaknesses
of the
AI-based platform
and the manual assessment methods.
Discuss the implications
of the findings
for diagnosis,
prognosis,
treatment efficacy evaluation,
and therapy planning
for individuals
with speech,
language,
and communication disorders.</li>
</ol>
