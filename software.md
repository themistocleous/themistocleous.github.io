# PhoneticsIPA
The Phonetics (IPAGreek) is a computational implementation (in a windows text editor) of Standard Modern Greek and Cypriot Greek "phonological grammar". The application enables users to transcribe text written in Greek orthography into the International Phonetics Alphabet (IPA).

- to type text in Standard Modern Greek orthography and convert it to IPA.
- to type text in Cypriot Greek orthography and convert it to IPA.
- to create lists of words in reverse order for dictionaries.
- to analyze text using the implemented regular expressions engine.

The application can help phoneticians, sociolinguistics, lexicographers etc. to automatically transcribe their data.  The application is now open sourced and you may download from GitHub. See details below:

# Praat Scripts

You may find several Praat scripts in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/themistocleous/praat_scripts). These are scripts for opening, saving, and manipulating sounds and Praat objects. I will be updating this repository as soon as I have something new to add.

# Keyboard layouts for Windows and macOS
![CG2](https://github.com/themistocleous/Keyboard_Layouts/raw/master/CG2.jpg)

Often we need to type symbols that do not exist in the standard keyboard layouts. One way to solve this issue is to assign specific symbols in several applications, such as Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer but with most applications this is not even an option. The best way to address this issue is by installing a specified keyboard layout. I created three keyboard layouts: one for writing Cypriot Greek and includes the characters that are needed to produce the post-alveolars,  a layout for accessing IPA symbols, and a layout for adding symbols when working with historical manuscripts (paleography).

You may find more updated information about Keyboard layouts [here](https://github.com/themistocleous/Keyboard_Layouts).
