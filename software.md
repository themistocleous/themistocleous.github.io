PhoneticsIPA is a windows Text Editor that allows the user to type text in standard Greek orthography and in Cypriot Greek and convert it to the International Phonetics Alphabet (IPA).

The editor has some added functionality for working with text corpora:
- Basic Text Statistics
- Reverse Text for morphological analysis.

# Part of Speech Taggers
Taggers allow the automatic labelling of corpora with Part of Speech labels.:
- Ancient Greek Tagger for tagging (adding POS labels) on Ancient Greek Texts and creating Ancient Greek corpora.
- Modern Greek Tagger for tagging a text in Standard Modern Greek.
- English Tagger that includes a morphological dictionary and a disambiguation algorithm for discriminating nouns and verbs.

# Lexicography Software
These include Graphical User Interphases (GUIs) for creating and viewing electronic dictionary, reverse algorithms for creating reverse dictionaries. A dictionary environment currently it includes a dictionary I created with Ancient Greek irregular verbs. The taggers and the Lexicography software are currently not freely available from the website.
