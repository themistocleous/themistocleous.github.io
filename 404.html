You mean it was only for a cloud<br> that we struggled so much?<br><br>  — Euripides, Helen</i><br><br>‘The nightingales won’t let you sleep in Platres.’<br>  Shy nightingale, in the breathing of the leaves,<br> you who bestow the forest’s musical coolness<br> on the sundered bodies, on the souls<br> of those who know they will not return.<br> Blind voice, you who grope in the darkness of memory<br> for footsteps and gestures — I wouldn’t dare say kisses —<br> and the bitter raving of the frenzied slave-woman.<br>  ‘The nightingales won’t let you sleep in Platres.’<br>  Platres: where is Platres? And this island: who knows it?<br> I’ve lived my life hearing names I’ve never heard before:<br> new countries, new idiocies of men<br> or of the gods;<br>                       my fate, which wavers<br> between the last sword of some Ajax<br> and another Salamis,<br> brought me here, to this shore.<br>                                               The moon<br> rose from the sea like Aphrodite,<br> covered the Archer’s stars, now moves to find<br> the heart of Scorpio, and alters everything.<br> Truth, where’s the truth?<br> I too was an archer in the war;<br> my fate: that of a man who missed his target.<br> <br> Lyric nightingale,<br> on a night like this, by the shore of Proteus,<br> the Spartan slave-girls heard you and began their lament,<br> and among them — who would have believed it? — Helen!<br> She whom we hunted so many years by the banks of the Scamander.<br> She was there, at the desert’s lip; I touched her; she spoke to me:<br> ‘It isn’t true, it isn’t true,’ she cried.<br> ‘I didn’t board the blue bowed ship.<br> I never went to valiant Troy.’<br> <br> Breasts girded high, the sun in her hair, and that stature<br> shadows and smiles everywhere,<br> on shoulders, thighs and knees;<br> the skin alive, and her eyes<br> with the large eyelids,<br> she was there, on the banks of a Delta.<br>                                                          And at Troy?<br> At Troy, nothing: just a phantom image.<br> That’s how the gods wanted it. And Paris, Paris lay with a shadow as though it were a solid being;<br> and for ten whole years we slaughtered ourselves for Helen.<br> <br> Great suffering had desolated Greece.<br> So many bodies thrown<br> into the jaws of the sea, the jaws of the earth<br> so many souls<br> fed to the millstones like grain.<br> And the rivers swelling, blood in their silt,<br> all for a linen undulation, a filmy cloud,<br> a butterfly’s flicker, a wisp of swan’s down,<br> an empty tunic — all for a Helen.<br> And my brother?<br>                          Nightingale nightingale nightingale,<br> what is a god?
