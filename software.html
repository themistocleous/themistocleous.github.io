                Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a progressive decline of language functions. Its symptoms are grouped into three PPA variants: nonfluent PPA, logopenic PPA, and semantic PPA. Grammatical deficiencies differ depending on the PPA variant.<br>
                Using an automated analysis of a short picture description task, this study showed that content versus function words can distinguish patients with nonfluent PPA, semantic PPA, and logopenic PPA variants. Verbs were less important as distinguishing features of patients with different PPA variants than earlier thought. Finally, the study showed that among the most important distinguishing features of PPA variants were elaborative speech elements, such as adjectives and adverbs.<br>

                    Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) was found to improve oral and written naming in post-stroke and primary progressive aphasia (PPA), speech fluency in stuttering, a developmental speech-motor disorder, and apraxia of speech (AOS) symptoms in post-stroke aphasia. This paper addressed the question of whether tDCS over the left IFG coupled with speech therapy improves sound duration in patients with apraxia of speech (AOS) symptoms in non-fluent PPA (nfvPPA/AOS) more than sham.<br>
                    Segmental duration was significantly shorter after tDCS compared to sham and tDCS gains generalized to untrained words. The effects of tDCS sustained over two months post-treatment in trained and untrained sounds. Taken together, these results demonstrate that tDCS over the left IFG may facilitate speech production by reducing segmental duration. The results provide preliminary evidence that tDCS may maximize efficacy of speech therapy in patients with nfvPPA/AOS.

        Listeners do not require long productions of speech to identify the accent of a speaker, often a single sound suffices. This study shows that using machine learning and information from a speech segment, namely a single sonorant sound /m n l r/, it is possible to distinguish two dialects of Greek: Athenian Greek and Cypriot Greek. In our future research, we will be exploring further this approach to identify medical conditions that influence speech production.<p></p>

Forty-five female speakers—20 Standard Modern Greek and 25 Cypriot Greek speak- ers—participated in this study. The spectral properties of stop bursts were calculated from the burst spectra and analyzed using spectral moments. The findings show that besides linguistic information, i.e., the place of articulation and the stress, the speech signals of bursts can encode social information, i.e., the dialects. A classification model using decision trees showed that skewness and standard deviation have a major contribution for the classification of bursts across dialects.<p></p>

Language and Speech, 59(4):433–461.<p></p>By exploring the timing of the Cypriot Greek L*+H prenuclear pitch accent, this study tested the predictions of three hypotheses about tonal alignment: the invariance hypothesis, the segmental anchoring hypothesis, and the segmental anchorage hypothesis. The findings on the alignment of the high tone (H) are both intriguing and unexpected: the alignment of the H depends on the number of unstressed syllables that follow the prenuclear pitch accent. The `wandering' of the H over multiple syllables is extremely rare among languages, and casts doubt on the invariance hypothesis and the segmental anchoring hypothesis, as well as indicating the need for a modified version of the segmental anchorage hypothesis. To address the alignment of the H, we suggest that it aligns within a segmental anchorage–the area that follows the prenuclear pitch accent–in such a way as to protect the paradigmatic contrast between the L*+H prenuclear pitch accent and the L+H* nuclear pitch accent.<p></p>

Acquiring Clitic Placement in     Bilectal     Settings:      Interactions     between     Social Factors. <em>Frontiers in Communication</em>.<p></p>
The C5.0 machine-learning algorithm was employed to model the interaction of sociolinguistic factors on the development of clitic placement in bidialectal children. The model shows that speakers acquire the relevant features very early, yet compartmentalization of form and function according to style emerges only as they engage in the larger speech community. <p></p>Frontiers 2017 Version: <a href="/assets/papers/fcomm.pdf"><b>[PDF]</b></a></td>

            <td style="border-color: white;"> Keyboard layouts for Windows and macOS. Often we need to type symbols that do not exist in the standard keyboard layouts. One way to solve this issue is to assign specific symbols in several applications, such as Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer but with most applications this is not even an option. The best way to address this issue is by installing a specified keyboard layout. 
            <p></p>There are three keyboard layouts: one for writing Cypriot Greek and includes the characters that are needed to produce the post-alveolars,  a layout for accessing IPA symbols, and a layout for adding symbols when working with historical manuscripts (paleography).
