I focus  on the acoustic  analysis of speech (vowels,  consonants, and
prosody),  the sociophonetic  aspects  of speech  production, and  its
clinical  applications.   I  also  focus on  the  development  of  new
methods,  which can  enable  the analysis  and  the classification  of
speech productions  using machine  learning, such  as state-of-the-art
neural network models  for the classification of  dialects from vowels
and consonants, and for the identification of speakers developing mild
cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's  Disease.  Also, I have published
work  related to  theoretical  Phonology, especially  with respect  to
prosodic structure and its interface with information structure.
