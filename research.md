<li>To determine how invariant and variant acoustic properties encode sociolinguistic categories: e.g., vowels, consonants, prosody, and language varieties.</li>

<li>To explain the effects of neurodegenerative conditions, such as Primary Progressive Aphasia, Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimerâ€™s disease, on speech and language.</li>

<li>To develop a multi-technique methodology that combines state-of-the-art neural networks, signal processing, and computational linguistics to model speech production and perception in neurodegenerative conditions.</li>
</ol>
