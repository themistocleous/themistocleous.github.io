# Research Program

My research program aims to define how physiological and
sociophonetic properties---dialect, gender, etc.---determine the fine acoustic
details of speech production. To this purpose, I employ experimental methods and
methods from signal processing and machine learning. Below, I summarize the main
trends of my current research: prosody, vowels and consonants, speech pathology,
language acquisition and diglossia, and writing and speech. I conclude, with
some ideas for future research.
